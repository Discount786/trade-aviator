HOW TO ADD YOUR IMAGES
========================================

Your images (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) need to be in the public folder.

STEP 1: Copy your images
-------------------------
1. Open File Explorer
2. Go to: C:\Users\44777\Downloads
3. Find your 6 images (numbered 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
4. Select all 6 images and COPY them (Ctrl+C)

STEP 2: Paste into public folder
---------------------------------
1. Go to: C:\Users\44777\new-project\public
2. PASTE the images (Ctrl+V)

STEP 3: Rename the images
--------------------------
Rename them to these exact names:
- Image 5 → trading1.jpg (or .png if that's the format)
- Image 6 → trading2.jpg (or .png)
- Image 7 → trading3.jpg (or .png)
- Image 8 → cjpghat1. (or .png)
- Image 9 → chat2.jpg (or .png)
- Image 10 → chat3.jpg (or .png)

IMPORTANT:
- Keep the same file extension (.jpg, .png, etc.) they already have
- Just change the name part (e.g., "5.jpg" becomes "trading1.jpg")

STEP 4: Refresh your browser
-----------------------------
After adding the images, refresh the page (F5) and they should appear!
